#### Things left to do at end of event
* Get all of the settings for views, content types, etc into Features
* Export all other types of settings into Feature modules
* Rearrange site code into sites/all/modules/contrib and .../custom
* Fix theme issues, i.e. labels and slider on single images
* Turn on aggregation of js and css
* Remove unnecessary content types - Event?,
* Location module isn't working the way it's expected
    - Locations should be part of store nodes which are nodereferenced where necessary
